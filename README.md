Explanation for Problem no 1
This line plot shows the sine and cosine functions, which are periodic functions with a period of 2π. The sine function has a range of [-1, 1] and the cosine function has a range of [0, 1].

From the plot, we can see that the sine and cosine functions are complementary functions, meaning that their sum is always equal to one. We can also see that the sine function is shifted to the right by π/2 compared to the cosine function.
